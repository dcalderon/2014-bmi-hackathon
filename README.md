## II. Software Design:
Translating model results to patient and doctor Hackathon members that wish to focus more on software implementation will work to address aspects of engaging the actual patient with the research results from above.  They will create “dummy” results so that they can progress while students are still working on the predicting results from part I. 

### We will focus on
determining the most relevant types of information to present to patients. This challenge, like most supervised clinical oncology informatics methods, predict survival and/or relapse. This can lead to functional insight and new ground-breaking therapies, but what’s important to give to current patients? Would you present simply their change of survival? Would you try and explain your entire model to them? What about visualizations? Is a report for the patient’s clinical preferable? These questions align with other challenges proposed by the NML competition.

### Other challenges to be addressed if there’s time
Effectively presenting the information to patients in ways that understandable to them (i.e. visualization techniques); Improving the communication mechanisms between patients and their providers Designing features that “empower” the patient Designing new ways to incorporate patient-generated data into clinical decision-making Note that part II doesn’t require a working GUI - perhaps a script that pulls out model results and creates a succinct 1-page printout for the patient, and a 1-page print-out for the doctor, is a good first step.
